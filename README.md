This is a fork of the original prject, meant to allow us easily add some fancy unicode 6 glyps to the list. Please note that since most Linux distributions doesn't currently support Unicode 6 glyps you may want to install a snapshot version of DejaVu fonts <http://dejavu.sourceforge.net/snapshots/> into ~/.fonts/.

.XCompose
=========

As explained in <http://canonical.org/~kragen/setting-up-keyboard.html>,
your Compose key in X11 is controlled by (among other things) the file
`.XCompose` in your home directory.  This file gives you a large set
of bindings for Unicode characters that are useful occasionally.

More contributions are welcome; there's a Git repository at
<http://github.org/kragen/xcompose>.  We're trying to come up with a
broadly acceptable set of keybindings that won't interfere with the
traditional Compose bindings, aren't too hard to type, and cover a
wide set of characters that are useful to use occasionally, making
them available without the need for specialized input methods.
